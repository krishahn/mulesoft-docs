= About VPC Internal DNS

If you choose to connect other networks to your VPC, you can use your custom private domain names by specifying your custom hostnames and the DNS server IP address through which resolve them.

Any request that matches your specified private hostnames, will first be resolved using your provided DNS servers. +
You can pass as many domains as you need, and up to 3 IP addresses.
