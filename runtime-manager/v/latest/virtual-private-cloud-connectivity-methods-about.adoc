= About VPC Connectivity Methods

If you need to connect your VPC to your internal network, or to another Cloud network, select the appropriate connectivity method for your use case. Then, contact your MuleSoft account representative to discuss your specific requirements. 
Once you have selected an option, download link:_attachments/VPC-Gateway-Questionnaire-v8.xlsm[the VPC discovery form] (requires at least MS Excel 2007 with macros enabled), then enter data to communicate the necessary details required for your connectivity method. Once they receive your form and answer any remaining questions, the CloudHub support team securely exchanges keys and supplies instructions on how to configure your router(s).

You can connect a Virtual Private Cloud to a datacenter using any of these methods:

. *Public Internet:* Default connectivity to CloudHub VPC.

. *IPsec tunnel with network-to-network configuration:* Connect a network to a CloudHub VPC with an link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec[IPsec] VPN connection as shown in the diagram below: +

[NOTE]
IPsec is, in general, the recommended solution for VPC to on-premise connectivity. It provides a standardized, secure way to connect, which integrates well with existing IT infrastructure such as routers/appliances.

. *VPC Peering:* Pair an Amazon VPC directly to a CloudHub VPC. +
If the services you are connecting to are hosted on AWS, then you can choose to peer your CloudHub VPC and your AWS VPC. +
The diagram below illustrates connecting a CloudHub VPC and Amazon VPC together directly through VPC peering: +

. *CloudHub Direct Connect:* If your network connects to your Amazon VPC using link:https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/[Amazon Direct Connect], you can create a hosted virtual interface to your CloudHub VPC.

The SLA for configuring VPC is 5 business days after link:_attachments/VPC-Gateway-Questionnaire-v8.xlsm[the VPC discovery form] has been completed and returned, though it may be completed sooner.
