== What is MuleSoft?

The mission of MuleSoft is to help organizations change and innovate faster by making it easy to connect the worldâ€™s applications, data, and devices. With its API-led approach to connectivity, MuleSoft provides the market-leading Anypoint Platform that enables organizations to build their application networks faster.

== What is Mule runtime?

Basically, Mule runtime is an engine for processing and orchestrating data. This runtime is the layer that facilitates development and deployment of reliable, highly available applications that define how Mule should support interaction between diverse systems. Using Mule runtime you can build enterprise-grade integration applications, called Mule applications.

[NOTE]
Mule runtime is often referred to as Mule ESB. Call it Mule for short. In more technical terms, Mule runtime is a Java-based enterprise service bus (ESB) based on SEDA (staged-event driven architecture).

[TIP]
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/downloading-and-starting-mule-esb[Download Mule with Studio] and start working with processing data across SaaS or backend systems with Mule applications.

== What is a Mule application?

A Mule application is a series of functions that act on incoming data. An app does not start until a user-defined event happens, like a change to a file. The event is encoded as a *Mule message*, which gets passed from one end of the flow to the other, passing information about the event to one or more systems, perhaps enriching the data in the message for a certain destination, like a webpage, device or database. The message is the wrapper for important data, which is typically accessible via the *message payload*, like `#[payload.something]`. It is up to the integration developer to design the flow(s) and configure how the components operate on messages that pass through. Components can be configured to connect to existing applications anywhere, cloud or on-prem.

Once a Mule app is deployed to Mule runtime, the app is ready to be kicked off by the event(s) to trigger a flow. You can deploy Mule applications to Mule runtime servers anywhere, and configure security and policies for them as well. In Mule apps *you write less custom code, and get more done through reuse.*

[TIP]
Consider APIs your ally when connecting assets. Starting with API design allows developers to decouple business logic from the APIs used to link digital resources together.

[[what-is]]
== What is Anypoint Platform?

Anypoint Platform is MuleSoft's *integration application and API suite*. It comprises a unique toolset that enables organizations to create, integrate, model, build, and deploy services, APIs, and Mule applications.

The Anypoint Platform tools are accessed primarily through a browser but also have command line tools and APIs. Through the platform it is possible to control most aspects of integration applications and APIs throughout their entire lifecycle.

[TIP]
An link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/[on-premises] version is available, enabling you to securely host Anypoint Platform on your infrastructure.

[[getting-started-dev]]
=== Developer Toolkit

After obtaining access to the Anypoint Platform, you are a few steps away from developing integrations with Mule.

. link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/download-and-launch-anypoint-studio[Download and Install Anypoint Studio]. Studio comes with a test Mule server.
. If you are an API developer, ensure you read up on link:/api-manager/[API Manager], accessible from Anypoint Platform, to design, publish and manage APIs.
. Check out templates, connectors and more from link:/getting-started/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange], where you can find and publish developer resources. You can use Exchange to publish private repositories too.

[NOTE]
If you're working with Mule outside Studio or you have an enterprise license, see how to link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/configuring-maven-to-work-with-mule-esb[Configure Maven] to properly manage the dependencies used by your Mule apps.

[[getting-started-deploy]]
=== Deployment Toolkit

For *API deployment*, see link:/api-manager[API Manager], accessible from Anypoint Platform.

[[app-network]]
== Application Network - Apps and APIs Together

APIs and applications are the nodes in a network that mediates between your backend/cloud systems and SaaS applications. Read the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/whitepaper/api/application-network[Application Network whitepaper].

Building an application network is a process that involves:

. *Redefining interactions* with existing digital resources
. *Creating APIs* at different levels of the enterprise to proxy and secure access to the resources, from the backend systems to the user experience, allowing you to abstract complexity at different organizational tiers.
. *Composing Mule applications* to consume the APIs
. *Manage your network* of connected assets using Anypoint Platform

[NOTE]
APIs and apps can be recomposed or changed out as business demands change.

You can run your apps on servers in the *cloud*, *on-premises*, or some *hybrid* version. Manage and monitor legacy or platform APIs. Manage API consumption via auto-generated proxy.

[[design-develop-apis]]
=== Anypoint Platform for APIs

Consider the action words that define the interactions between two systems or applications. Define these different actions in APIs. Use a proxy application to control access to them.

After planning your development strategy, you are ready to begin designing APIs to support each piece of the connectivity puzzle for your organization. We recommend using link:http://raml.org/[RAML], the API-modeling language, to describe your APIs. RAML allows you to define the methods and resources of a REST-ful API in a syntax similar to that of *YAML*. The Anypoint Platform even uses RAML to auto-generate interactive API documentation for each API via its own API Portal, and Anypoint Studio uses RAML scaffolded Mule flows to implement APIs.

Use link:/api-manager/designing-your-api#accessing-api-designer[API Designer] from within your browser for design tasks, or link:/apikit/[APIkit] from Studio, which is commonly leveraged to implement an API in a Mule application. You can manage APIs defined in any format, by proxy for example. We promote API development following an API model where APIs are segmented into three logical layers of your organization:

* *System APIs* - provide access to backend systems given appropriate permissions
* *Process APIs* - decouple data transformation from backend systems and other processes
* *Experience APIs* - collates data to provide the presentation layer for end user, internal or external to your organization


=== Publish an API in an API Portal

After deploying an API, use API Portals to publicize the API and attract a user community. Create a multi-page portal for users to consume your public APIs and find assets, such as examples and policies, and set up users to access your private APIs. From the portal editing environment, include an API Notebook to convey technical workflows, for example, how to make an authenticated call to your RAML-based API. Include images, attachments, and an API Console for simulating calls to your RAML-based API. Engage the community through interaction with the API to solicit feedback and contributions.Â 

The best way to present your API to users is through the link:/api-manager/creating-an-api-notebook[API Notebook], a web-based, persistent, JavaScript-supported workspace that can generate an API client from a RAML API definition.

This allows users to explore and test examples for the resources in your API, executing authenticated live calls to an API on a real server or on an empty API interface.

You can make the API Notebook available to everyone and even save it as a "gist" in your GitHub account, making it versionable, forkable, shareable, and embeddable anywhere as markdown text.


=== Manage APIs with API Manager

//image:api-logo.png[AnypointAPI_manager,width=26]

link:/api-manager[API Manager], formerly known as *Anypoint Platform for APIs*,Â is an API and service registry and governance platform. Built from the ground up to support cloud and hybrid use cases, the platform governsÂ all of your service and API assets, whether internal or external, behind a firewall or in the cloud, all via one platform. Place a proxy in front of your application to apply traffic policies, view usage metrics and more.

You can either register a Mule application by imbuing it with link:/api-manager/api-auto-discovery[auto-discovery parameters], or taking an existing legacy API and triggering creation of a Mule proxy to govern and monitor the API. Either case results in registration of your API with your API Manager.

Once an API is registered, you can easily link:/api-manager/applying-custom-policies[apply governance policies] to it via the web UI, such as *throttling* or *API whitelisting*. Apply such policies after providing parameter values, and then simply by clicking the *Activate* button. You can also generate your own custom policies if you require something that isn't covered by the lengthy list of pre-built policies.

With your API registered, Anypoint Platform will start link:/analytics/analytics-chart[tracking analytics] about API usage and performance.

At that point you could create an link:/api-manager/engaging-users-of-your-api[API Portal], where users of your API can browse interactive API documentation that is automatically generated from your API's RAML definition file. You can expose other content from this API Portal as well.

*Manage a Legacy API*

Alternatively, you may want to use Anypoint Platform to manage an API that was not developed using MuleSoft software. In that case, you can use the API Manager to deploy an auto-generated proxy. Through this proxy, Anypoint Platform can apply policies and obtain analytics information.

[TIP]
The platform supports maintenance of multiple versions of an API, each with its independent set of policies, analytics and portal.




=== Develop Mule Applications

To ramp up quickly with link:https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/esb/what-mule-esb[Mule runtime], a flexible ESB to connect services or applications together quickly, read the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8[Mule runtime documentation]. Familiarize yourself with link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/[Anypoint Studio], an IDE. Studio is mainly a visual design tool, and does not require in-depth knowledge of Mule runtime. However, you can configure many Mule app and runtime attributes from within the IDE.

[NOTE]
Start setting up your link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/setting-up-your-development-environment[Anypoint Studio Development Environment].
You can design and develop your Mule applications using either the:

* *Graphical user interface* for drag-and-drop of flow elements and easy configuration in properties windows, or
* An *XML editor* where these same elements can be configured

Each building block in a Mule application flow represents a modular part of a process along which Mule messages are transmitted. Thanks to link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/datasense[DataSense], you can visualize the metadata structure of a Mule message at any given point in a flow. This data may be accessed and referenced within your app, using the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule Expression Language (MEL)], which is a Mule application-specific syntax. link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave[DataWeave] is a powerful tool for data transformation accessible from the *Transform Message* component. Use Dataweave to transform data from one type to another through its intuitive UI. You can also code the desired transformation by hand in the editor.

[TIP]
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-message-structure[See] what is inside a Mule message.


Mule supports very many internet communications protocols out of the box, such as FTP and SMTP. Mule applications support use and re-use of elements called link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors] that facilitate connections, normally to web services which handle essential business services: databases, SaaS providers, payment systems, etc. See the whole connector offering here on link:/getting-started/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange].

[TIP]
If you do not see the Anypoint Connector you need in Anypoint Exchange, consider creating your own connector using the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/[Anypoint Connector DevKit]. link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/setting-up-your-dev-environment[Set up your development environment] and follow the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/devkit-tutorial[DevKit Tutorial].

You can also use link:/anypoint-mq/[Anypoint MQ] to coordinate messaging between applications, Object Store to share content between applications, and more.

After your Mule application has been designed, you can seamlessly add _unit testing_ to your continuous development environment using link:/munit/v/1.2.0/[MUnit], a Mule application testing framework embedded within Studio.

Make sure that your integrations and APIs behave the way you intend by designing and running _test suites_, a collection of tests using resources such as _assertions_, _verifications_, _mocks_, and _spies_. +
MUnit also allows you to run integration tests in a local environment allowing you to start a local FTP/SFTP, DB, or mail server.

Get quality metrics for your development by running link:/munit/v/1.2.0/munit-maven-support#coverage[coverage reports].

You can run your application and test suite from within the IDE using the embedded *Mule runtime*, or deploy your application to production (or a development environment) in the cloud on *CloudHub*, also without having to leave the IDE.


=== Deploy and Manage Mule Apps

//image:runtime-manager-logo.png[CloudHubLogo133high,width=26]

link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager] provides multiple tools to link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[Manage] and link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-applications[Monitor] your running applications. Runtime Manager provides a single "glass pane" through which you can view all activity relevant to your running Mule applications, regardless of deployment scenario (cloud/on-prem).

Runtime ManagerÂ allows you to integrate and orchestrate application activity, data sources, and services on-prem and in the cloud.

Runtime Manager exposes important information about your live applications:

* link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[E-mail alerts]
* link:/runtime-manager/notifications-on-runtime-manager[In-platform event notifications]
* link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-dashboards[Monitoring dashboards] that display performance metrics of both applications and servers
* Transaction-level detail through the link:/runtime-manager/insight[Insights page]
* link:/runtime-manager/logs[Event logs] for applications deployed to the cloud.
* Applications deployed on-premises can link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[send log information to third party software]

Additionally, if your application is deployed to the cloud, you can link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[manage many features of CloudHub deployment] using Runtime Manager:

* link:/runtime-manager/managing-application-data-with-object-stores[Object Stores]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-queues[Queues]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-schedules[Schedules]
* link:/runtime-manager/secure-application-properties[Secure Application Properties]
* link:/runtime-manager/virtual-private-cloud-about[Virtual Private Cloud]


[TIP]
To better understand how options differ between applications deployed to CloudHub and those deployed on-premises, see link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule].


// this sub section might be redundant, as it's sort of explained already


== How to Use Anypoint Exchange

link:/getting-started/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange] is a public repository of Anypoint Platform resources but you can create organization-specific repositories called _private exchanges_ to share templates, connectors, examples, RAMLs, and WSDLs throughout your organization.  Whether private or public, Exchange lets you create pages for each item with explanation text, videos of how to use the artifact, and links to documentation. Share these resources to engage your developer community and catalyze innovation.
